I'm a young ambitious machine learning developer who spends most of my waking ours on reading, coding and writing.

I've been working as a CTO in my startup wemuda and has been working as a consultant on multiple occasions.

During my work at the startup, I've acquired many skills that might be irregular for most developers, but nonetheless has proven incredibly valuable;
My co-founder and I had to do everything ourselves, including hiring, sales, operations, development, management and so on.

Therefore I'm able to combine a good business understanding with highly technical skills, something that is very unique in developer circles.
